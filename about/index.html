    <p>
      I have graduated Computer Science at “Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University of Iași, Romania. I currently have a bachelor’s degree that I got in
      <strong>2019</strong>
      and a master’s degree in “Computational Optimization” in
      <strong>2022</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since graduation I've been working in the tech industry primarily as a
      <strong>.Net Developer</strong>. During the 
      years I had the pleasure/displeasure to work with a number of technologies revolving around the server-side of web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interests span from custom keyboards and open-source software to server racks and tinkering with hardware.
